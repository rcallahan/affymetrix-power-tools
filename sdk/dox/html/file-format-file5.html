<center><b>DRAFT</b></center><p>File5 is a library which provides a simplified C++ interface to the HDF5 library. It is also a specification of "what" is stored. The "how" is taken care of by the HDF5 library it is built on.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="file5_why_hdf5"></a>
Why HDF5?</h2>
<p>HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) is a data model, file format and library for file IO. It is mature and permits the storage of multiple named binary data sets in one file along with user transparent byte-ordering, resizing, compression, and checksuming of the stored data. With HDF5, we can concentrate on what is to be stored rather than the how. By using this library we hope to have a richer data format than the file formats which are currently in use at Affymetrix. (Eg: HDF5 does not have a 2 or 4 GB limit.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="file5_why_file5"></a>
Why File5 (aka A5)</h2>
<p>With all of the features HDF5 offers, the interface is rather large. Additionaly, there is a bit of book-keeping of the objects which HDF5 uses. (data-types, data-sets, data-files, etc.) The aim of File5 is to offer a set of C++ objects which simplify working with the datasets with a simpler API and by taking care of this resource tracking.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="File5_classes"></a>
File5 Classes</h2>
<p>Here is a short list of the classes a File5 programmer can use, along with short descriptions. See "test-file5.cpp" for more examples.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_Metadata"></a>
File5 Metadata</h3>
<p>HDF5 allows metadata to be attached to HDF5 objects. This metadata maps a string to a simple HDF5 dataset. In File5 usage, we reserve HDF5 metadata for File5 use. User metadata is kept in the File5_Group metadata. This representation is restricted to "string keys" and "string
values". This loses some of the data richness, but has two benefits: user metadata wont conflict with file5 metadata and the user metadata can be chunked, compressed and checksumed. (Which doesnt happen with File5 attributes.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_File"></a>
File5_File</h3>
<p>"File5_File" represents a File5 file in the filesystem. It is a subclass of File5_Group. (It provides an interface to the "H5F_*" functions.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_Group"></a>
File5_Group</h3>
<p>"File5_Group" is similar to a filesytesm directory. It maps names to the actual HDF5 objects. Vectors, Matrixes, Tsv and other Group objects are contained within it. (It provides an interface to the "H5G_*" functions.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_Matrix"></a>
File5_Matrix</h3>
<p>"File5_Matrix" is a simplified multi-dimensional matrix class. The user can resize the dimensions, but new dimensions cant be added. (A 2x2 dataset can become a 10x10 dataset, but it cant become a 2x2x2 dataset; That increases the number of dimensions from 2 to 3.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="file5_Object"></a>
File5_Object</h3>
<p>"File5_Object" is the base class of the File5 objects. (It provides the interface to getting and setting attributes.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_UserMeta"></a>
File5_UserMeta</h3>
<p>"File5_UserMeta" should be split out of "File5_Group".</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_Vector"></a>
File5_Vector</h3>
<p>File5_Vector is the workhorse of File5 and most likely what you will use the most. It is modeled after std::vector: it is 0-based, can be resized, has integer indexing and push_back. It also holds a number of basic types: strings, chars, ints, floats.</p>
<p>Unlike std::vector, it is not a template. The allowed types are defined in the File5 library.</p>
<p>Index: | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Data: | a | b | c | d | e | ^ ^ | +- file-end +- fill-end</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="File5_Tsv"></a>
File5_Tsv</h3>
<p>File5_Tsv is a porting of the TsvFile format to file5. It has most of the features and interface of TsvFile but is better in many ways. Principally:</p>
<p>updateable compresed binary checksumed column based storage</p>
<p>File5_Tsv is built out of File5_Vectors, but as an end user, you dont need to know that. The File5 library does the bookkeeping.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="file5_notes"></a>
Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The suggested suffix for File5 formatted files is the suffix of the base file plus "5". (Eg: ".cel" -&gt; ".cel5", ".foo" -&gt; ".foo5")</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are several tools which can be used to examine the contents of an HDF5 file. "h5dump" and the hdf5 viewer are two useful ones which are part of HDF5.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>File5 also has a utility program "apt-file5-util" which allows you to export and import File5 formatted data to and from TsvFile formatted files. </li>
</ul>
